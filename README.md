# Autonomous_Irrigation
As part of my Internet of Things independent study, I developed an autonous irrigation system.
This project consists of a Raspberry Pi, soil sensors, and water pumps.
The purpose of this project was to make the caretaking of house plants easier, by allowing it to
act automatically and be altered via a local website hosted on the system.
